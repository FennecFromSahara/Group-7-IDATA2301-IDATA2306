# Group-7-IDATA2301-IDATA2306

This is a project for IDATA2301 - Web Technologies and IDATA2306 - Application Development. In the Web Technologies course, the task was to build a website with a given theme, ours was to make a frontend website for a fake coffeeshop called "Mocha Nooka Cafe". And in the IDATA2306 - Application Development course, the task was to build a backend server for said website. The result is a fully functioning coffee shop website built with React JS for the frontend, that receives data from a MySQL database through a Spring Boot Application as the backend server.

# How to run
Because the website is decoupled, it contains two folders, one for the frontend, and one for the backend. Each folder contains their own README.md files with instructions on how to run the applications.
